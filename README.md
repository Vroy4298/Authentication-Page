Authentication Page 🔐 | Tailwind CSS + JavaScript
This dynamic and responsive authentication page was originally developed as part of my first project, "Cook Book", a meal planner website. However, I am now publishing it separately so that it can be useful to others who want to create a dynamic authentication system using JavaScript and Tailwind CSS.

✨ Features:
📌 Single-page authentication (Login & Signup toggle)
🎨 Fully responsive design with Tailwind CSS
⚡ JavaScript-powered interactivity
🔒 User-friendly form validation
This project is now open-source and available for anyone who wants to integrate a smooth and responsive authentication module into their web app. Feel free to explore, modify, and contribute! 🚀
